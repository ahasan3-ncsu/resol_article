What to do next?
- Visualizations
  - MD thermal spike
- Illustrations
  - Surface mesh for calculation
- Figures
  - Redo xe_dr and xe_hist with a bigger bubble

Details:
- Intro needs to talk about the UZr paper.

- Is there a way to get uncertainty in re-solution rate?
  There probably is a way.
  We say that meshes give us converged results.
  So, the error propagates directly from chi(E, l).

- Maximum recoil distance graph.
  The pdf version takes up a lot of memory.
  But I also don't want to use a raster image.
  What to do?

- Some simulation visuals.
  Can we make the vispy background white?
- New illustrations. How many?

- TTM simulations
  Are there any existing dump files?

- Figure legends required by npj?
