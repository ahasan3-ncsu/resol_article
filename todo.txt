What to do next?
- Visualizations
  - MD thermal spike
- Figures
  - Redo xe_dr and xe_hist with a bigger bubble

Details:
- Intro needs to talk about the UZr paper.

- Is there a way to get uncertainty in re-solution rate?
  We say that meshes give us converged results.
  So, the error propagates directly from chi(E, l).

- TTM simulations
  Are there any existing dump files?

- Figure legends required by npj?
