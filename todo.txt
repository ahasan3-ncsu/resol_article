-2. Blue atoms are not noticeable
x3. No justification for eqs 13 and 14
x4. From eq 21 to 22. Definition of h(P).
x5. Definition of re-solution in DART. Is the comparison meaningless?

-1. Equations need to be brief, clear, and straightforward.
x2. Eqs 24 and 25 are unnecessary.
x3. Derivation of eq 21 from eq 20.
x4. Expand the abstract. High-level description. Contribution to nuclear.
-5. Mixed use of PKA and homogeneous model.
	They might not mean the same thing.
	Shouldn't PKA induce collision cascades
	that are heterogeneous in nature?
	MD snapshots of kinetic energy
	to show the difference between models.
x6. Typical fission rate. Why 1E-14?
	Use the annual report for typical fission rate.

Homogeneous vs PKA thoughts
- thermal spike -> hetero (thermal)
- PKA -> homo (ballistic) + hetero (thermal)
- PKA -> collision cascades -> heat spikes -> hetero (thermal)
- PKA/thermal spike split doesn't align with homo/hetero split!
- Since we've done what Govers did, let's just go with low/high
  energy distinction.
- refactoring is necessary
