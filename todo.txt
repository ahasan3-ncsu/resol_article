What to do next? (at most 3 items)
- TTM results

Details:
- TTM/MD simulation details

- BCA methods citations

- Explain the ion profiles.

- Convergence criteria

- How are the xi deviations calculated?
- Is there a way to get uncertainty in re-solution rate?
  We say that meshes give us converged results.
  So, the error propagates directly from chi(E, l).

- Discussion and comparison with literature

- Figure legends required by npj?
