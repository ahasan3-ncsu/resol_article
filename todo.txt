What to do next? (at most 3 items)
- BCA methods

Details:
- Use siunitx for units.
  This can be done later.

- BCA methods & citations
  Links to the github repos

- Explain the ion profiles.

- Convergence criteria

- How are the xi deviations calculated?
- Is there a way to get uncertainty in re-solution rate?
  We say that meshes give us converged results.
  So, the error propagates directly from chi(E, l).

- Discussion and comparison with literature

- Figure legends required by npj?
