What to do?
Why does this feel overwhelming?
Because there are too many things to consider.
Let's offload the tasks here.

- Maximum recoil distance graph.
- Comparison with UO2, UC and UZr.
- Intro needs to talk about UZr work.
- TTM simulations? Are there any existing dump files?
- Figsize according to the page size.
- Colorscheme in stopping power graph.
- Colors in general needs consistency.
- Labels for colorbars. Units?
- Font and font size for matplotlib plots.
- Font and font size for latex main text and figures.
- New illustrations. How many?
- Some simulation visuals.
- Can we make the vispy background white?
