What to do next? (at most 3 items)
- TTM and ax^k+c equations

Details:
- TTM equations, results and visuals.
  Wait for the sims to be done.

- Explain the ion profiles.

- Is there a way to get uncertainty in re-solution rate?
  We say that meshes give us converged results.
  So, the error propagates directly from chi(E, l).

- ax^k + c for the final results

- Full equation with bubble pressure

- Discussion and comparison with literature

- Figure legends required by npj?
