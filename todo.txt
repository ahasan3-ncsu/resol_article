Let's offload the tasks here.
We need things in order.

What to do first?
- literature data
- std devs in chi
- error propagation

Details:
- Comparison with UO2, UC and UZr.
- Intro needs to talk about the UZr paper.

- Error bars wherever possible.
- Is there a way to get uncertainty in re-solution rate?
  There probably is a way.
  We say that meshes give us converged results.
  So, the error propagates directly from chi(E, l).
  Also, it's probably the chi(E, l) at the center that matters.

- Functional form for the final result

- Figsize according to the page size.
- Font and font size for matplotlib plots.
  Helvetica/Symbol fonts for figures.
- Tick labels need to be consistent for all subfigures.

- Colorscheme in stopping power graph.
  Colors in general need consistency.
- Labels for colorbars? Units only?

- Maximum recoil distance graph.
  The pdf version takes up a lot of memory.
  But I also don't want to use a raster image.
  What to do?

- Some simulation visuals.
  Can we make the vispy background white?
- New illustrations. How many?

- TTM simulations
  Are there any existing dump files?

- Figure legends required by npj?
