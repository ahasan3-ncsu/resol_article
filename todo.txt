What to do next? (at most 3 items)
- describe b_eq
- discussion

Details:
- Fix tense

- Figure captions

- Use siunitx for units.
  This can be done later.

- How are the xi deviations calculated?
- Is there a way to get uncertainty in re-solution rate?
  We say that meshes give us converged results.
  So, the error propagates directly from chi(E, l).

- Discussion and comparison with literature

- Figure legends required by npj?
