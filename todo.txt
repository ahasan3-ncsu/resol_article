What to do?
Why does this feel overwhelming?
Because there are too many things to consider.
Let's offload the tasks here.

Yeah, let's just write before touching the figures.
The bare minimum works.
Don't worry about making it the final version.
Other issues might come up when I write.

- Figsize according to the page size.
- Font and font size for matplotlib plots.
  Helvetica/Symbol fonts for figures.
- Tick labels need to be consistent for all subfigures.

- Colorscheme in stopping power graph.
  Colors in general need consistency.
- Labels for colorbars? Units only?

- Comparison with UO2, UC and UZr.
- Intro needs to talk about the UZr paper.

- Maximum recoil distance graph.
  The pdf version takes up a lot of memory.
  But I also don't want to use a raster image.
  What to do?

- Some simulation visuals.
- Can we make the vispy background white?

- New illustrations. How many?

- Error bars wherever possible.
- Is there a way to get uncertainty in re-solution rate?
  There probably is a way.
  We say that meshes give us converged results.
  So, the error propagates directly from chi(E, l).
  Also, it's probably the chi(E, l) at the center that matters.

- TTM simulations? Are there any existing dump files?

- Figure legends required by npj?
