	A U-Mo alloy based monolithic fuel design has been identified as the fuel
	type for conversion of the United States High-Performance Research Reactors
	(HPRRs). However, the U-Mo monolithic fuel exhibits excessive swelling
	during operation. To understand the fuel evolution under irradiation,
	mesoscale and engineering level fuel performance models require the
	knowledge of fundamental mechanistic behavior of fission products in the
	fuel. As such, understanding the progression of Xe gas bubbles in the fuel
	is crucial. The Xe gas bubbles act as a sink for individual Xe atoms
	(trapping of Xe) and subsequently grow in size after absorption. Under
	irradiation, the Xe atoms in the gas bubble are re-solved back into the
	fuel matrix, and this process reduces the bubble size. In this work, we
	investigate the re-solution of xenon gas bubble in U-Mo fuel with the
	molecular dynamics simulations. The efficiency of both the homogeneous and
	heterogeneous resolution mechanism are investigated via the primary knock
	on atom and thermal spike methods, respectively. For low energy
	interactions, the collision cascades caused by a single fast moving primary
	knock on atom were studied. The higher energy range was studied by the
	thermal spike method. The study sheds light on the atomic scale processes
	at play for fission gas re-solution in nuclear fuel. The present atomic
	scale simulations indicate that low energy interactions are not effective
	in the resolution process. The high energy interactions destroy smaller
	bubbles completely. The re-solution rate computed in this work, combined
	with the trapping rate of Xe, provides a full picture of the evolution of
	Xe gas bubbles in U-Mo.

\section{Introduction}

To understand the fuel evolution under irradiation, mesoscale and engineering
level fuel performance models require the knowledge of fundamental mechanistic
behavior of fission products in the fuel. As such, understanding the
progression of Xe gas bubbles in the fuel is crucial. The Xe gas bubbles act as
a sink for individual Xe atoms (trapping of Xe) and subsequently grow in size
after absorption. Under irradiation, the Xe atoms in the gas bubble are
re-solved back into the fuel matrix, and this process reduces the bubble size
\cite{ye2023}. In this work, we investigate the re-solution of xenon gas bubble
in U-Mo fuel with the molecular dynamics simulations. The efficiency of both
the homogeneous and heterogeneous resolution mechanism are investigated via the
primary knock on atom and thermal spike methods, respectively.

\section{Computational details}

This study has been conducted using the LAMMPS software package \cite{lammps}
to quantify the Xe re-solution rate in U-Mo. Two models of re-solution are
implemented: primary knock-on atom (PKA) and thermal spike. Re-solution through
PKAs happens via atomic collision cascades (i.e., due to the nuclear stopping).
Re-solution through thermal spikes occurs due to the electronic stopping, which
raises the temperature of the fission track to a value that is higher than the
melting temperature of the material. A U-Mo-Xe angular-dependent potential
(ADP) was used for the MD simulations \cite{beelerADP}. This potential is
capable of describing the body-centered cubic phase of U-Mo alloys and is able
to reproduce the stable structure, modulus of elasticity, room temperature
density, and melting point. Since this work focuses on high-energy interactions
such as primary knock-on atom (PKA) and thermal spike events, the distance
between the ions and atoms can become very small, these interactions are not
described accurately by the classical interatomic potential alone. Therefore,
the repulsive potential of Ziegler, Biersack, and Littmark (ZBL)
\cite{ziegler1985}, which provides a realistic description of the ion-ion
repulsive interactions, is chosen to act at very short inter-atomic distances
for the potential used.

A $160 \times 160 \times 160$ \r{A}$^3$ supercell is used for the PKA model.
This amounts to $\sim$8 million atoms in the system. Figure \ref{fig:struct}
shows the cross-section of such a supercell. The system is equilibrated at 400
K at a pressure of 0 bar within the NPT ensemble using the Nos\'e-Hoover
barostat and thermostat. Using the resulting configurations, spherical bubbles
of 4 nm diameter are created by removing a stoichiometric number of uranium and
molybdenum atoms and incorporating gaseous Xe atoms at a given density within
in the resulting void. Using this method, both the over- and under-pressurized
bubbles are created. For the 4 nm bubble, 200 and 400 Xe atoms are
investigated, which correspond to pressures of 120 MPa and 551 MPa,
respectively. It is to be noted that the equilibrium pressure of such a bubble
is 333 MPa \cite{beeler2020improved}. The system is then further equilibrated
in the NPT ensemble. Finally, displacement cascades are performed using a
constant volume simulation cell with a Nos\'e-Hoover thermostat at the edges of
the simulation box to act as a heat sink. This allows the resulting shock-wave
emission and local heating to be contained within the cell. This also prevents
interactions with the periodic image of the system across the boundaries. The
cascade is initiated by selecting a single PKA, located approximately 5.5 nm
from the center of the bubble, and scaling its velocity to a kinetic energy of
successively higher energies (up to 500 keV). The simulations are carried out
for 120 picoseconds. The Xe atoms within the bubble are carefully monitored to
see whether any gas resolution occurs. Xe atoms that remain more than 1 nm from
the surface of the initial spherical bubble at the end of the simulation are
counted as re-solved Xe atoms. The simulation is repeated for each bubble
density and PKA energy using varying initial PKA directions in order to gather
statistics. Snapshots of such a PKA simulation are provided in Figure
\ref{fig:pka}.

The thermal spike method is a useful model used to describe the interaction
caused by the swift heavy ions on a target material. These interactions occur
mainly through electronic excitation of the material through a four-step
process. During the timescale of $10^{-17}-10^{-16}$ s, the swift heavy ions
interact with the electrons of the target materials and the deposited energy is
accumulated in the electronic subsystem \cite{toulemonde2002, wang1994}.
Secondly, this energy is redistributed locally in the electronic subsystem in
about $10^{-15}-10^{-14}$ s via electron-electron collisions, heating up the
'cold' electrons. At around $10^{-13}-10^{-12}$ s, the energy from the
electrons is transferred to the lattice via the electron-phonon coupling.
Finally, the energy is transferred among the atoms resulting in a rapid rise of
lattice temperature ($\approx$10$^{4}$ K) in a cylindrical zone of typically
few nm radius called the thermal spike \cite{patra2019}.

For the thermal spike model, the simulated supercell is $120 \times 120 \times
50$ \r{A}$^3$, which holds $\sim$1.5 million atoms. A xenon bubble has been
inserted in the middle of the supercell with a Xe/vacancy ratio of 0.2.
According to Beeler et al., this ratio provides an equilibrium bubble pressure
\cite{beeler2020improved}. The atoms present in a cylindrical zone of 35 \r{A}
radius along the thermal spike axis are excited with a high kinetic energy to
simulate local heating due to electronic stopping. A total energy of up to 30
keV/nm is imparted to the cylindrical region of the thermal spike. Figure
\ref{fig:spike} provides a few snapshots of a thermal spike simulation where
the thermal spike collides with the gas bubble head-on. The position of the
thermal spike is varied to account for the off-centered thermal spike behavior
as well.

\section{Results and Discussion}

There is very limited re-solution in the PKA model. Only a few simulations
showed a single re-solved Xe atom in the system. Snapshots of one such
simulation are shown in Figure \ref{fig:pka}. On the other hand, the thermal
spike model showed significant re-solution of Xe atoms. Thus, we only consider
heterogeneous (thermal spike) re-solution of Xe atoms from thermal spikes in
our model. The re-solution in this model is dependent on the total amount of
effective energy deposited to the lattice ($S_{e,eff}$). The re-solution data
for both the under-pressurized (200 Xe atoms) and the over-pressurized (400 Xe
atoms) bubble are analyzed. Figure \ref{fig:resol}(a) shows the fraction of
re-solved Xe atoms in the system as a function of deposited energy. From
observing the data, it can be hypothesized that the fraction of re-solved atoms
is independent of the bubble pressurization (or Xe density). An exponentially
saturating function (\ref{eqn:sat}) is used to model the available data.

	deposited to the lattice.}
	\label{fig:resol}
\end{figure}

\begin{align}\label{eqn:sat}
	\chi_0 &= 1 - \exp[-\alpha (S_{e,eff} - S_{e,c})]
\end{align}
where $\alpha$ is a tuning parameter ($\alpha = 5.88 \times 10^{-4}$) and
$S_{e,c}$ is the cutoff energy deposition needed for any re-solution to occur
($S_{e,c} = 2.47 \times 10^{-13}$). Setyawan et al. \cite{setyawan2018}
employed a similar functional model for their study of Xe re-solution in
UO$_2$. The model fit to the data is shown in Figure \ref{fig:resol}(b).

In this work, only on-centered thermal spikes have been simulated so far.
Off-centered thermal spikes are expected to have diminishing effects to the
re-solution as they go farther away from the Xe gas bubble. Let us denote the
fraction of re-solved Xe atoms due to any thermal spike as $\chi$, the distance
between the bubble center and the thermal spike center as $r$, the distance
between the bubble center and the origin of the thermal spike as $x$, and the
fission rate as $\dot{F}$. The heterogeneous re-solution rate can then be
expressed as a volume integral.

\begin{align}
	b_{het}
	&= \sum_{i=1}^2 \int_{r=0}^{\infty} \int_{x=0}^{\infty}
		2 \pi r \chi_i \dot{F}  dr dx \\
	&= \dot{F} \sum_{i=1}^2 \int_{r=0}^{\infty}
		\bigg( \frac{\chi_i}{\chi_{0,i}} \bigg)
		2 \pi r dr \int_{x=0}^{\infty} \chi_{0,i} dx
\end{align}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=10cm]{images/offcentered.pdf}
	\caption{Re-solution due to off-centered thermal spikes.}
	\label{fig:off}
\end{figure}

In the absence of off-centered thermal spike data, we approximate
$\int_{r=0}^{\infty} \bigg( \frac{\chi_i}{\chi_{0,i}} \bigg) 2 \pi r dr$ as
$0.25 \pi r_c^2$, as calculated in \cite{setyawan2018}. Here, $r_c = R_{bubble}
+ R_{spike}$ is the cutoff distance for thermal spikes. The re-solution of Xe
atoms is assumed to be improbable for $r \geq r_c$. Thus, heterogeneous the
resolution rate, $b_{het}$, can be defined as:

\begin{align}
	b_{het}
	&= 0.25 \pi r_c^2 \dot{F} \sum_{i=1}^2 \int_{x=0}^{\infty}
		[1 - \exp(-\alpha (S_{e,eff,i} - S_{e,c}))] dx \\
	&= 0.25 \pi r_c^2 \dot{F} \sum_i y_i \int_{x=0}^{\infty}
		[1 - \exp(-\alpha (\zeta S_{e,i} - S_{e,c}))] dx \label{eq:dx}
\end{align}
where $y_i$ is the independent fission product yield of the fission product $i$
and $\zeta = S_{e,eff} / S_{e}$ is the fraction of fission product energy that
is imparted to the lattice. In this work, $\zeta$ is assumed to be 0.73 as per
\cite{govers2012, setyawan2018}. Therefore, $S_e$ for all possible fission
products needs to be known for the evaluation of the integral in the above
equation.

We choose to evaluate the $S_e$ values for Xe-140 and Sr-94 in U-10Mo based on
the fission reaction $_0^1n + _{92}^{235}U \rightarrow _{54}^{140}Xe +
_{38}^{94}Sr + Q$. Even though it is one of many possible fission reactions
that may take place, Xe-140 and Sr-94 can still be considered as
representatives of heavy and light fission products. The rationale behind this
is that the two aforementioned species appear close to the two peaks of a
typical fission product yield graphs.

$S_{e,Xe}$ and $S_{e,Sr}$ as a function of the distance traversed by the Xe
atom is shown in Figure \ref{fig:irad}. This data is generated using the
Iradina software \cite{crocombette2019irad}. The following model is fit to
represent the $S_e$ data in the integral in equation \ref{eq:dx}.

\begin{align}
	S_{e,Sr} &= 19.7 \exp(-0.00273 x^{3.71})
		+ 6.8 \exp(-0.424 x^{1.45}) \\
	S_{e,Xe} &= 21.3 \exp(-0.239 x^{1.78})
		+ 5.23 \exp(-4.67 \times 10^{-8} x^{11})
\end{align}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=10cm]{images/iradina.jpg}
	\caption{Total electronic stopping power ($S_e$) of Xe in U-10Mo
	calculated with the Iradina code as a function of distance traveled by
	Xe from the location of the fission reaction.}
	\label{fig:irad}
\end{figure}

Finally, after evaluating the integral, we get the following expression for the
re-solution rate of Xe gas bubbles in U-10Mo as a function of fission rate
(fissions/cm$^3$/s).

\begin{align}
	b_{het} = 9 \times 10^{-19} \dot{F}
\end{align}

The re-solution rate calculated in this work is compared with the rate defined
by the model used in DART \cite{ye2023}. The associated model is described
below.

\begin{align}
	b_{dart} &= b_0 \cdot \dot{F} \cdot G \\
	b_0 &= R_{spike}^2 \cdot \mu_{ff} \\
	G &=
	\begin{cases}
		1 & ,R_{bubble} \leq \lambda \\
		1 - (\frac{R_{bubble}-R_{resol}}{R_{bubble}})^3
		  & ,R_{bubble} > \lambda
	\end{cases}
\end{align}
where $b_0$ is the bubble destruction probability, $\dot{F}$ is the fission
rate, and $G$ is a piecewise function representing different resolution modes
for small and large gas bubbles. $b_0$ can be estimated with the interaction
volume of a thermal spike with bubbles, $b_o = R_{spike}^2 \times \mu_{ff}$,
where $R_{spike}$ is the radius of a thermal spike and $\mu_{ff}$ is the recoil
length of fission fragments. In the piecewise function G, $R_{bubble}$ is the
bubble radius, $\lambda$ is the gas-atoms knock out distance, and $R_{resol}$
is the thickness of the annulus within which all gas-atoms are knocked out.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=10cm]{images/onlyDart.pdf}
	\caption{Re-solution rate used in the DART model \cite{ye2023}.}
	\label{fig:dart}
\end{figure}

Ye et al. reported the optimized values of $b_0$, $\lambda$, and  $R_{resol}$
in \cite{ye2023}. These optimized values are used to get the following concise
expression for a bubble radius of 2 nm.

\begin{align}
	b_{dart} = 2 \times 10^{-18} \dot{F}
\end{align}

The re-solution rates from the model developed in this work and the model
described in \cite{ye2023} are presented in Figure \ref{fig:comp} for a broad
range of plausible fission rates. The re-solution rate used in DART is 2.2
times larger than the value calculated in this work. However, the re-solution
rate described in this work is only a lower limit since only Xe (a lower energy
fission product) is used as a possible fission product for calculations.
Overall, the result from this work agrees on the order of magnitude of
re-solution rate used in DART.

\section{Conclusion}

Molecular dynamics simulations are used in this study to provide a re-solution
rate of Xe gas bubbles in U-10Mo fuel. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous
re-solution have been simulated using the primary knock-on atom and thermal
spike methods. Homogeneous re-solution is found to be negligible in describing
the overall re-solution behavior. The fraction of re-solved Xe gas bubble atoms
seems to be invariant with respect to bubble pressure and Xe density. This
fraction is then used to model the re-solution fraction as a function of
effective imparted energy into the lattice. Afterward, the electronic stopping
power of Xe fission products in U-10Mo is used to provide a re-solution rate of
Xe gas bubbles. The re-solution rate of Xe gas bubble atoms in U-10Mo is found
to be $b = 9 \times 10^{-19} \dot{F}$, where $\dot{F}$ is the fission rate
specified as fissions/cm$^3$/s.
